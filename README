General Information
===================

gtk-update-icon-cache is a tool from GTK+ to update icons and themes caches.

It is split from the GTK+ sources by the Gentoo Gnome team to help GTK+ 2 and 3
to co-exist better by extracting the single conflicting tool.

Official sources of this tool are located at:

    https://github.com/GNOME/gtk/blob/master/gtk/updateiconcache.c

Installation
============

gtk-update-icon-cache requires GLib >= 2.45 and gdk-pixbuf >= 2.30.

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

Updating
========

* Clone gtk+ repository: `git clone git://git.gnome.org/gtk+`.
* Checkout the sources of gtk+ at the required version.
* Synchronize dependencies to glib and gdk-pixbuf, even if not strictly needed.
* Copy `gtkiconcachevalidator.c`, `gtkiconcachevalidator.h` and
  `updateiconcache.c` to the `gtk/` folder.
* Copy the locales from gtk+ `po/` directory to gtk-update-icon-cache `po/`
  directory and remove unneeded translation using the script
  `utils/extract-po.py`:

    $ for po in ../gtk+/po/*.po ; do \
        utils/extract-po.py ${po} ./po/$(basename ${po}; \
      done

Finally do a release using `make distcheck`.
